Attached (appended) is a file called html2corpus.prl... it will take a
directory full of html files and turn them into a corpus, creating the
necessary 5 files if run on hops, barley or malt, which are:

corpus.raw
corpus.stemmed
corpus.stemmed.hist
corpus.tokenized
corpus.tokenized.hist

.. syntax is:

./html2corpus.prl ./directory/with/files corpus


The following field partitions are used.

.T = title tag
.K = keywords META tag (used by search engines, very common)
.W = previously abstract, now description META tag (also common)
.A = previously author, now the body text with all HTML markup stripped
